\begin{frame}{Understanding the Reports}
	Understanding Infer's bug reports:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Static analysis is about \textit{all possible} executions\\
		NOT \textit{actual executions} that are constrained by runtime behaviours.
		\item\textbf{Think: "Could this be a \textit{plausible} execution?"}
		\item Infer makes mistakes!\\
		Certain checkers are terrible ...
		\item Some syntactic constructs in C confuse the checkers\\
		Incomplete and buggy implementation
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How to use Infer}
To use Infer productively:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Learn to triage the bug reports efficiently
	\item Read the first and last lines of each bug report\\
	Ignore the middle!
	\item Look for code smell in functions and translation units\\
	Bugs patterns are repeated by the same author...
	\item Think: Can we fuzz this?\\
	Combine static analysis with dynamic testing ...
\end{itemize}
